1
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,700
A droid soldier from the Empire?!
What's it doing here?!

2
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,080
An unwanted guest...
No matter, go after Sisbell!

3
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,450
Stop!

4
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,080
You didn't think I'd let you go?

5
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:47,200
Sisbell can't escape, and you
can't accomplish anything alone.

6
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,450
She's from the royal family.

7
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:54,120
Don't you think she has a good reason
if she's talking to an Imperial soldier?

8
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,370
Her reasoning doesn't matter.

9
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:02,410
As a princess, just talking to
the likes of you is against the rules.

10
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,990
It's a serious crime that would dethrone her.

11
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,450
It's also a crime to make
so much noise at night.

12
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,870
Stop disturbing the neighbors!

13
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:20,990
Beginning: Rise of a New World
Triggered by the Two

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,290
Jhin?!

15
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:29,540
I was wondering what was up with you,
but you got tangled up with some thugs?

16
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,830
Hey, he's that guy!
That demon that kicked me!

17
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,540
Well hello, Captain. Doing well, I see?

18
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,410
Why are you here?

19
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:44,830
Unfortunately, I have a more pressing matter
and don't have time for chitchat.

20
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,290
Object?! Why has the Empire's
experimental weapon been deployed?!

21
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,910
Astral energy detected. Initiate screening.

22
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:01,950
One, two, three, four, five...

23
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,660
Six astral power readings.

24
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,910
Iska, it detected Captain's astral energy!

25
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,830
Shoot!

26
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:15,620
Initiating captivity of priority target,
Pure Blood 9LC.

27
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,870
Ignore it! We're only after Princess Sisbell!

28
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,740
Initiating elimination of obstacles.

29
00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:00,160
It seems we have multiple unexpected guests,
but this works in our favor.

30
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,740
No, you won't.

31
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,830
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

32
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,290
We're only here to take
the Sovereignty's criminal back.

33
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,790
Why would the Empire try to protect her?

34
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:22,830
I don't care about that. You kicked
our boss down into the vortex.

35
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:27,290
That's why I want to pummel you into the ground.

36
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,830
Do it.

37
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,540
No more Mr. Nice Guy, huh?!

38
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:43,870
Are you serious?! This isn't a battlefield.
This nation is completely unrelated!

39
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:49,450
Not to worry. Everything will
be blamed on the losing side.

40
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,910
Take comfort in that and die.

41
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,330
Are you okay?

42
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,790
Iska?!

43
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:12,200
Iska, we need to stop it
before it sends the data!

44
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,240
Buy me some time!

45
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,830
Roger that!

46
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,080
It's hard!

47
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,990
I'm going to destroy that weapon. Stay back.

48
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,700
Wh-Why are you helping me?

49
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,580
You said you couldn't become my ally!

50
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,080
I have my own reasons.
There's a lot that I haven't told you.

51
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,870
But at the very least, I don't plan on
giving you up to it or the Masked Lord!

52
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,830
Iska, this isn't fair...

53
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:24,160
If you show me such niceness, I...

54
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,040
Nene!

55
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,290
The coordinates are entered! I'm ready!

56
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,370
Piercing Shot!

57
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,370
Did Nene cause that explosion?

58
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,290
Yeah. We need to hurry up and join them.

59
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:55,830
I agree, except I would be the one going.

60
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,120
Did you assume I can't teleport objects?

61
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,120
You won't be able to use
your sniper rifle anymore.

62
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,120
I don't need it!

63
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,950
What?!

64
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:32,910
I admire your quick thinking,
but you're unlucky.

65
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:40,330
I lost the evidence to prosecute Sisbell,
but it looks like the stars are on my side.

66
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,620
Jhin?!

67
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,040
Gasoline!

68
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,580
One hundred years ago, our great founder
turned the Empire into a sea of flames.

69
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,540
I'm recreating that moment.

70
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:10,660
Know that it is the avenging fire
by us astral spirits!

71
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,700
What's going on?
The fire astral art isn't working...

72
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,740
No, wait. Where's this wind coming from?

73
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,450
I see.

74
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:38,580
This wind... So an Imperial soldier
gained power from the vortex.

75
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,540
An interesting research subject indeed.

76
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:48,450
Shut it. Don't violate our boss
with your disgusting words.

77
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:57,120
Oh, well. It's time to call it quits.
It's not worth the pursuit anymore.

78
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,540
It was a fun evening.
I'll return the favor soon.

79
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,330
Y-You did it?

80
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:13,200
No, something's wrong.

81
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,830
Reject.

82
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,120
Shutting off primary energy supply.

83
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,580
Switching to secondary energy.

84
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,200
Wh-What is this weapon?!

85
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,240
This is different from the Object I know!

86
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,450
Iska, this light is weird! It's too strong!

87
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,870
It's not electrical or from fuel.
What exactly is this energy?!

88
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,790
It's the astral energy's light!

89
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,490
What?!

90
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:51,200
Object... What's hidden inside of you?!

91
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,950
Nene, take cover!

92
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,200
Life Form Integra.

93
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,200
Wh-What was that explosion?!

94
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,410
It's coming from where Iska is.

95
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,620
Reloading energy.

96
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,740
Directing to the core.

97
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,740
I-It can fire repeatedly?!

98
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,830
I won't let it!

99
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,200
Piercing Shot!

100
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,490
Unlocking all functions.

101
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,450
No way...

102
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:46,700
Nene, regroup with Jhin! The fire will be
disastrous if it continues to spread!

103
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,580
You need to evacuate
the people nearby quickly!

104
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,950
What? But what about you?

105
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,870
I'm going to stop it.

106
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,540
Okay.

107
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,450
Don't die, Iska!

108
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,950
What exactly are you...?

109
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:21,370
He's there fighting...
Sisbell, now's the time to believe!

110
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,330
Ready to launch.

111
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,790
Light! Replay the star's past!

112
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,120
Iska, now!

113
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,990
Sisbell?!

114
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,540
It's replaying a sandstorm
that occurred in this location.

115
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,290
But it's just a smokescreen!

116
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,990
That's enough!

117
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,700
Thanks.

118
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,790
Of course.

119
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,120
Operation failure.

120
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,950
Ejecting the core, Beast of Catalysc.

121
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,540
Get back, Sisbell!

122
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,700
Iska!

123
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,200
What is that...?

124
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,910
Embers are reaching this far?!

125
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,540
This is bad, Captain!

126
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,910
Hurry! Evacuating the people comes first!

127
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,830
Iska...

128
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,490
Sisbell!

129
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,830
I won't... end here...!

130
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,580
Ice Calamity: Flooding Snow Lights!

131
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,240
Alice?!

132
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,830
What are you doing here?!

133
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,830
Right back at you.

134
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,950
Give my sister back!

135
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,490
Vines!

136
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,200
Icicles!

137
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,410
Iska!

138
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,620
Right!

139
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,580
No way!

140
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,790
What in the world are you?

141
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,540
An astral spirit?

142
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:36,830
If that's the case, what does the Empire
plan to do with this weapon?!

143
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,540
Alice, your blossom!

144
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,330
Wh-What are you saying, Iska? That's my--

145
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,200
Now!

146
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,040
Bloom forth!

147
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,620
So lu reinen xel.

148
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,790
What language is that?

149
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,290
An astral spirit's?

150
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,200
Elmei shel feo mielles.

151
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,950
How much destruction is it going to cause?!

152
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:49,540
Iska, I want to fight you,
but now isn't the time.

153
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:54,830
This kind of destruction is meaningless.
The future I strive for isn't this.

154
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,830
Neither is the future I strive for.

155
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,990
Just for now, we'll join hands.

156
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,370
Let's do this!

157
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:15,410
Ris sia sohia ahz cia r-teo.

158
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,660
Pierce through!

159
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,120
Wall!

160
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,490
Ice Calamity...

161
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,040
Stars...

162
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,120
Ez xiss clar lefmihas xel.

163
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,490
Endless Fan and Sword Dance!

164
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,160
Awaken!

165
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,870
It's over!

166
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:06,450
We lost the Object's signal...

167
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,830
An unexpected setback.

168
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:13,950
It seems we need to watch out for
the Successor of the Black Steel.

169
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:18,580
We'll move onto the next stage.

170
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,080
Thanks.

171
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,490
Huh?

172
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:38,950
Ugh, no, this isn't right!

173
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:44,370
What am I saying? I don't want to
fight with you, I want to fight you!

174
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,990
You make it sound so bad.

175
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:51,200
But it's the truth! As a rival,
we really are going to settle this!

176
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,450
Sister...?

177
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,540
Sisbell! You're awake.

178
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,660
Sister.

179
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,080
Yeah?

180
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,450
You know Iska, don't you?

181
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,200
Huh?

182
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,540
I've been wondering about it.

183
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,410
What is your relationship with him?

184
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,910
Well, actually--

185
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,910
No, I don't know him at all!

186
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,240
Huh?!

187
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,160
Sister, it's too late to lie about it!

188
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,120
It's the truth. Right?

189
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:42,040
R-Right! I have no clue who she is, either.

190
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:50,330
I see. So you and Iska aren't acquaintances.

191
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,910
Right.

192
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,290
That's good.

193
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,540
Huh?

194
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,870
I've come to a conclusion!

195
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:06,370
Iska! You're the dream knight for me,
Sisbell Lou Nebulis IX, the next queen!

196
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:10,620
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What are you saying, Sisbell?!

197
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,950
This does not concern you, Sister.

198
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,790
She can't do this! Right?!

199
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:20,200
Huh? Um, well...

200
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Iska!

201
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,240
Iska, where are you?!

202
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,290
Sorry, my friends are calling me,
so I'm gonna go...!

203
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,700
Hey, wait!

204
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:38,370
Iska! I will not give up! I give you my word!

205
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:06,740
So the Eight Great Apostles' experimental
weapon yielded an unexpected result.

206
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,410
Way to go, Issy.

207
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:13,490
Hmph. Anyway, where is the Emperor?

208
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:18,740
It's been a while since he set out.
He's probably enjoying his time.

209
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,330
Now... It won't be much longer
until they find out about that...

210
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:40,080
It's been a while since I felt this tranquility.

211
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:47,490
Imperial soldier... I've grown bored
of this world, but you intrigue me.

212
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,620
Who is it?

213
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,160
This energy... I didn't think
you'd come see me here.

214
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,580
It's you, isn't it, Emperor Yunmelngen!

215
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:12,950
Hey. I have something fun to tell you.

216
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,580
Welcome home, Uncle.

217
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:29,910
Thank you, Kissing.
It was quite a pleasant evening.

218
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,580
What about me?

219
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,580
It'll be good timing.
Let's prepare you for the election.

220
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,200
You called for me, My Queen?

221
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,870
I apologize for summoning you here.
I have a question for you.

222
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,700
Of course.

223
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,990
It was you who leaked intel about
where Sisbell was headed, am I right?

224
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:06,080
And another thing. Are you the real Elletear?

225
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,740
Lady Alice...

226
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,910
I wonder why we keep meeting
in situations like this?

227
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:35,370
I'd ask the same thing.

228
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:40,330
Anyway, pretend you don't know me
in front of people from the Sovereignty.

229
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,200
Even in front of my little sister.

230
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,620
Okay.

231
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:50,950
This is actually very exciting.
A secret just between the two of us.

232
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,830
Why are you enjoying this?

233
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:56,160
I-I'm not enjoying it!

234
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,160
Okay, then.

235
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,910
See you when I do.

236
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:49,940
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World
